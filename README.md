# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering

**Problem Description:**
This project focuses on exploring the Netflix dataset to learn more about the content available on the platform. We have data about movies and TV shows, their details, and where they can be viewed in different countries. By combining this data with external sources like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes, we can extract valuable information.

**Project Goals:**
Our objectives for this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: We'll clean the data, address missing information, and thoroughly analyze the dataset to find trends, patterns, and connections among various attributes.

Content Availability: We aim to figure out the types of content available in different countries and spot any differences or preferences.

Netflix's Focus: We'll investigate whether Netflix has been emphasizing TV shows over movies in recent years.

Content Clustering: We'll use text-based features to group similar content, which will help us create a recommendation system based on the content.

**Project Summary:**
Our project's main goal is to analyze the Netflix dataset, which includes data about movies and TV shows available on Netflix up to 2019. Netflix is the world's largest online streaming platform with over 220 million subscribers. By analyzing and clustering this content, we can improve the user experience through personalized recommendations, which could reduce subscriber turnover.

**Project Steps:**
Our project follows these steps:

1.) Handling Missing Data: We'll take care of any missing data in the dataset.

2.) Processing Nested Columns: We'll process columns with nested data (like director, cast, and genre) to make the information clear for analysis.

3.) Rating Categories: We'll categorize ratings into groups, such as adult, children's, and family-friendly.

4.) Exploratory Data Analysis: We'll dig deep into the data to uncover valuable insights that can help prevent subscriber churn.

5.) Creating Clusters: We'll create clusters based on various attributes like director, cast, country, genre, rating, and description. We'll use techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve our analysis.

7.) Clustering Algorithms: We'll use clustering algorithms like K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to create different types of clusters.

8.) Content-Based Recommendations: Finally, we'll develop a content-based recommender system using a cosine similarity matrix. This system will analyze what users have watched and provide personalized recommendations to enhance their experience.
